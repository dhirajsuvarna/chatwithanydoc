Q9. Common Application Startup Problems
Q9.1 Cannot find license file
Most applications have a default location in their application directory hierarchy. You can override this with the LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable. This problem can occur when this variable is set wrong, or the default location for the license is missing.


Q9.2 No such feature exists
The most common reason for this is that you're using the wrong license file, or an outdated copy of the file.


Q9.3 Cannot connect to license server
Usually this means the server isn't running. It can also mean the server is using a different copy of the license file, which has a different port number than the license file you're currently using indicates. You can use the lmdiag utility to more fully analyze this error.


Q9.4 License server does not support this feature
This means the server is using a different copy of the license file than the application. They should be synchronized. This error will also report `UNSUPPORTED' in the debug log file.
